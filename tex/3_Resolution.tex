Nonclausal methods, in general, require a large number of resolution rules,
making implementation difficult.

\section{Clausal Resolution}

Clausal resolution was suggested as a proof method for classical logic by
Robinson in 1965~\cite{Robinson65}, and was claimed to be suitable to be performed
by computer, as it has only one rule of inference that may be applied many
times.
